<body>
    My name is Eleni Cooper and I’m a Senior majoring in Communications Design with an IM&T minor. Web design is the perfect intersection of my Design and IT specializations and I have enjoyed designing and developing websites since early high school. I’m in the honors program and am a VPA Leadership Scholar. I love to crochet and I collect flag pins from every new country I visit. I cut and color my own hair when I get bored, with varying degrees of success. My go to hair color is pink but I’ve tried purple, green, orange, and red too!
