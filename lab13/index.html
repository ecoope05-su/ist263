        <p>
            My name is Eleni Cooper and I’m a Senior majoring in Communications Design with an IM&amp;T minor. Web design is the perfect intersection of my Design and IT specializations and I have enjoyed designing and developing websites since early high school. I’m in the honors program and am a <strong>VPA Leadership Scholar.</strong> When I graduate I hope to start on the track to becoming an Art Director at a design firm.
