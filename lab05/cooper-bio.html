    <h1>Eleni's Biography</h1>
    
    <p>
        My name is Eleni Cooper and I’m a Senior majoring in Communications Design with an IM&amp;T minor. Web design is the perfect intersection of my Design and IT specializations and I have enjoyed designing and developing websites since early high school. I’m in the honors program and am a <strong>VPA Leadership Scholar.</strong> When I graduate I hope to start on the track to becoming an Art Director at a design firm.

        I love to crochet and I collect flag pins from every new country I visit. I cut and color my own hair when I get bored, with varying degrees of success. My go to hair color is pink but I’ve tried lots of shades including:
