                <h2>Early Maps</h2>
                <p>Public transit maps of London were first developed in the 1860s concurrently with the introduction of the first Underground railway, the modern-day Metropolitan Line. The map superimposed the railway tracks onto a standard city map of London to show where passengers were in relation to the streets above them. Once the various privately owned railways began the process of merging into one network that would become the London Underground, the first network map was created in 1908. These maps proved difficult to read, as the geographical approach resulted in an extremely cramped central London to accommodate outlier stops in the suburbs.</p>

                <h2>Harry Beck's Innovation</h2>
                <p>In 1931, Harry Beck was inspired by electrical circuit diagrams to create the iconic abstracted geometric tube map that has inspired most transit wayfinding since. Rather than showing the accurate distances in real space, Beck’s map showed stations in relation to each other in a legible grid layout. Every line was either horizontal, vertical, or a 45-degree diagonal. While the idea was originally rejected for being too out of the box, with a few tweaks, a trial of the design was released as a pocket map in 1933. It was a classic from the moment it got into passengers’ hands, and it was fully adopted from there. </p>

                <h2>Evolution of the Diagramatic Map</h2>
                <p>Over the next 28 years, Beck tweaked his map based on feedback, swapping out colors and testing different angles for diagonal lines. While Beck considered the 1950 version of the map his best work, and eventually left his masterpiece in new hands when he stepped away from London Transport in 1960. Since then, the core system he created has endured, with most changes simply accommodating a growing system with new stations and lines.</p>
